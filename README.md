# Neural Network w/ Javascript

This project was meant for learning purposes only. I wanted to understand how a NN worked, and how i could build one of my own.

My goal with this project.
  - Learn how a neuralnetwork works.
  - Understand the basic math that surrounds neuralnets.


I started by learning about matrix calculations and how they fit into neural networks. After building my own very basic version of NumPy (matrix) i started reading up on how i could use matrices to represent nodes in a network. How dot operation worked, and how to feed data to a network. After this i started with the difficult part, backpropagation. This took awhile for me to understand because i lack the intermediate math skills of calculus. 
Slowly but surely i started to fit the pieces together and successfully built this simple XOR neural network from scratch in javascript. Im happy to share this project even though i have forgotten most of what i've learned.

## This is my first XOR Neural Network - 100% coded in Javascript.

### Tools
  - Matrix library (Built from scratch)
  - XOR NN (Build from scratch)
  - Logging

Everything is created from scratch.
